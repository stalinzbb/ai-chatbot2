# Figma MCP Integration ‚Äì Reference Guide

## Overview

The chatbot relies on the **Figma Desktop MCP server** (`http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`) as its primary design data source. To cover gaps that MCP cannot address (e.g., enumerating every token in a file), we layer in a lightweight Figma REST fallback that only activates when a `fileId` is explicitly provided. All tooling is surfaced to the LLM through the Vercel AI SDK with `inputSchema` definitions compatible with OpenRouter's GLM-4.6 models.

---

## Module Layout (`/lib/mcp/`)

- `client.ts` ‚Äì Singleton MCP client with connection pooling, timeouts, and graceful shutdown.
- `tools/` ‚Äì Collection of MCP wrappers and the REST-enhanced aggregator:
  - `get-design-context.ts`
  - `get-variable-defs.ts`
  - `get-metadata.ts`
  - `get-screenshot.ts`
  - `get-code-connect-map.ts`
  - `list-file-variables.ts` *(hybrid MCP + REST)*
- `utils.ts` ‚Äì Helpers for deep-cloning MCP responses, parsing XML metadata, and normalising output before it reaches the model.

Deprecated REST-only tools (`lib/ai/tools/query-figma-components.ts`, `lib/ai/tools/get-design-tokens.ts`) remain for reference but are no longer wired into the chat workflow.

---

## Integration Points

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` | Registers MCP tools + aggregator, handles OpenRouter errors (e.g., 402 insufficient credits), and streams responses to the UI. |
| `lib/ai/prompts.ts` | Guides the LLM on when to call each tool and how to interpret outputs (including aggregator datasets). |
| `components/message.tsx` | Renders generic `tool-*` outputs, screenshots, and structured JSON results in expandable panels. |
| `.env.local` | Hosts all secrets: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `FIGMA_MCP_SERVER_URL`, `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and file IDs used by the aggregator. |

---

## Environment & Prerequisites

1. **Figma Desktop** must be running with the relevant file open.
2. **MCP server** must be enabled in Figma Desktop (Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Model Context Protocol).
3. **Figma PAT** (`FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`) is required for the REST fallback used by `listFileVariables`.
4. **OpenRouter API key** must belong to an account with credits; otherwise every request returns HTTP 402.

For full setup instructions, see `SETUP.md` (env configuration) and `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` (current operational status / known issues).

## Tool Catalogue

### Core MCP Wrappers

All wrappers accept `nodeId?`, `clientLanguages?`, and `clientFrameworks?`. If `nodeId` is omitted, MCP uses the currently selected node in Figma Desktop.

| Tool | Description | Typical Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getDesignContext` | Returns implementation details and generated UI code for a component. | ‚ÄúShow me the code for the primary button.‚Äù |
| `getVariableDefs` | Fetches design tokens/variables associated with a node/page. | ‚ÄúWhat tokens are applied to this component?‚Äù |
| `getMetadata` | Produces XML describing the page/node hierarchy. | ‚ÄúWhat components exist in the Web Master file?‚Äù |
| `getScreenshot` | Captures a PNG screenshot of the node. | ‚ÄúWhat does the checkout header look like?‚Äù |
| `getCodeConnectMap` | Surfaces Code Connect mappings for the node. | ‚ÄúWhere is this component implemented in code?‚Äù |

### Hybrid Aggregator ‚Äì `listFileVariables`

**Purpose:** Combine MCP discovery with REST endpoints (`getFileVariables`, `getFileComponents`, `getFileStyles`) to enumerate tokens, styles, and components without manual node selection.

**Key Inputs:**
- `fileId` (optional but highly recommended) ‚Äì unlocks REST enrichment.
- `includeVariables`, `includeComponents`, `includeStyles` ‚Äì toggles sections of the response.
- `pageNameFilter`, `maxResultsPerSection`, etc. ‚Äì fine-grained filters (see source file for full schema).

**Output:** Structured JSON that groups results by collection/page and annotates which data originated from MCP versus REST.

---

## Working with Node IDs

- **From the Figma URL:** `https://www.figma.com/file/<fileKey>/<fileName>?node-id=1-2` ‚Üí Node ID `1:2`.
- **Via `getMetadata`:** Inspect the XML tree to map friendly names to IDs.
- **Via Selection:** Select the layer in Figma Desktop before calling the tool (works when `nodeId` is omitted).

---

## Example Workflows

### ‚ÄúWhere is Button/Primary used in the Web Master file?‚Äù
1. `getMetadata({ nodeId: "0:1" })` ‚Üí find the `Button/Primary` node ID in the XML output.
2. `getCodeConnectMap({ nodeId })` ‚Üí retrieve Code Connect mappings.
3. `getDesignContext({ nodeId })` ‚Üí provide implementation details in the response.

### ‚ÄúList every token in the Product Tokens file.‚Äù
1. `listFileVariables({ fileId: env.FIGMA_PRODUCT_TOKENS_FILE_ID, includeVariables: true })`.
2. Encourage the user to open the file in Figma Desktop if MCP returns empty results.

### ‚ÄúCapture a screenshot of the native checkout header.‚Äù
1. `getScreenshot({ nodeId: "321:654" })` ‚Üí stream PNG content back to the chat UI.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP tools return empty results | Target file not open in Figma Desktop or incorrect node selected. | Prompt user to open the file / supply explicit `nodeId`. |
| `listFileVariables` missing data | No `fileId` provided or Figma PAT lacks access. | Provide `fileId`, verify PAT permissions. |
| Chat shows ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having trouble sending‚Ä¶‚Äù | OpenRouter returned 402 (insufficient credits). | Add credits or switch to test provider for local development. |
| XML parsing errors | Figma returned large metadata payload. | Narrow the scope (`pageNameFilter`) or fetch specific nodes. |

---

## Next Steps / Enhancements

- Automate detection when Figma Desktop is not reachable and surface a user-friendly prompt.
- Cache REST responses (Redis) to minimise repeated `listFileVariables` calls.
- Add integration tests that mock MCP + REST responses to guard against schema regressions.
- Explore additional MCP tooling (e.g., semantic search) once billing and availability are stable.
# Figma MCP Integration - Complete Guide

## üéâ Overview

Your AI chatbot now uses **Figma Desktop's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** instead of the Figma REST API to access design system information. This provides more powerful capabilities like code generation, screenshots, and Code Connect mappings.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. MCP Client Module (`/lib/mcp/`)

- **`client.ts`**: Singleton MCP client that manages connection to Figma Desktop
- **`tools/`**: 5 MCP tool wrappers for Vercel AI SDK
  - `get-design-context.ts` - Get UI code for components
  - `get-variable-defs.ts` - Get design tokens/variables
  - `get-metadata.ts` - Get file/page structure
  - `get-screenshot.ts` - Get component screenshots
  - `get-code-connect-map.ts` - Get code implementation mappings

### 2. Integration Points

- **Chat API Route** (`/app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`): Replaced old Figma REST API tools with 5 new MCP tools
- **System Prompts** (`/lib/ai/prompts.ts`): Updated to guide LLM on how to use MCP tools
- **Environment Variables** (`.env.local`): Added `FIGMA_MCP_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`

### 3. Deprecated Files

Old Figma REST API tools are marked as deprecated but kept for reference:
- `/lib/ai/tools/query-figma-components.ts` - Deprecated
- `/lib/ai/tools/get-design-tokens.ts` - Deprecated

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` now includes:

```bash
# Figma MCP Server URL - For local Figma Desktop MCP server
FIGMA_MCP_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp
```

### Prerequisites

1. **Figma Desktop** must be running
2. **MCP server** must be enabled in Figma Desktop

  }
}
```

## üîç How to Use

### Getting Node IDs

**Method 1: From Figma URL**

Figma URLs contain node IDs:
```
https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2
                                                      ^^^^
                                                    Extract this!
```

The node ID is `1:2` (convert hyphens to colons).

**Method 2: Use `getMetadata`**

First call `getMetadata` to get an XML structure with all node IDs, then use those IDs in other tools.

**Method 3: Currently Selected Node**

If user has the right Figma file open and a component selected, tools will automatically use the selected node when `nodeId` is not provided.

### Workflow Examples

#### Example 1: "Where is Button/Primary used in the Web Master file?"

```typescript
// Step 1: Get file structure to find Button/Primary node ID
await getMetadata({ nodeId: "0:1" }); // Page-level

// Step 2: Parse XML to find node ID for "Button/Primary"
// Let's say we found nodeId: "456:789"

// Step 3: Get code implementation location
await getCodeConnectMap({ nodeId: "456:789" });
```

#### Example 2: "What's the value of the 2X border radius token?"

```typescript
// Option A: If user has tokens file open and selected
await getVariableDefs(); // No nodeId needed

// Option B: With specific node ID
await getVariableDefs({ nodeId: "123:456" });
```

#### Example 3: "Show me the code for the Web Navigation component"

```typescript
// Step 1: Find the component node ID
await getMetadata({ nodeId: "0:1" });

// Step 2: Get the code
await getDesignContext({ nodeId: "789:012" });
```

## üöÄ Running Locally

### Start the Chatbot

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The chatbot will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Requirements

1. **Figma Desktop running** with MCP server enabled
2. **Relevant Figma file open** in Figma Desktop
3. **Environment variables configured** in `.env.local`

### Testing MCP Connection

Run the discovery script:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/discover-mcp-tools.ts
```

Run the integration test:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-mcp-integration.ts
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations

### 1. Local-Only (Currently)

- MCP server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`
- **Only works locally** - won't work when deployed to Vercel
- **Future solution**: Set up remote MCP server or use tunneling

### 2. Requires Open File in Figma Desktop

- MCP tools work with the **currently open file** in Figma Desktop
- Users need to have the right file open
- Or provide Figma URLs with node IDs

### 3. Node ID-Based (Not Name-Based)

- Tools work with **node IDs**, not component names
- Can't directly search "find all Button components"
- Must use `getMetadata` first to find node IDs

### 4. No Cross-File Search

Unlike REST API which could search across multiple files, MCP works with one file at a time (the one open in Figma Desktop).

## üîÑ Comparison: MCP vs REST API

| Feature | Figma REST API | Figma MCP Server |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Search by component name | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (need node ID) |
| Search across multiple files | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (one file at a time) |
| Get design tokens | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Get file structure | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Generate code | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Get screenshots | ‚úÖ Yes (limited) | ‚úÖ Yes (better) |
| Code Connect mappings | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Works remotely | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (local only) |
| Requires Figma Desktop | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to Figma Desktop MCP server"

**Solution**:
1. Make sure Figma Desktop is running
2. Check that MCP server is enabled in Figma Desktop preferences
3. Verify the server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`

### "Nothing is selected"

**Solution**:
1. Open the relevant Figma file in Figma Desktop
2. Select a component/frame
3. OR provide a `nodeId` parameter explicitly

### Tools returning errors

**Solution**:
1. Ensure you have the correct Figma file open
2. Verify the node ID exists in the open file
3. Check Figma Desktop console for errors

### "SSE error: Non-200 status code"

**Solution**:
- This usually means the MCP server isn't properly initialized
- Restart Figma Desktop
- Check MCP server settings in Figma Desktop

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Option B: Hybrid Approach

Combine MCP + REST API:
- Use **REST API** for search/discovery (finding components by name)
- Use **MCP** for detailed queries (code, screenshots, Code Connect)

### Option C: Workarounds

- Accept Figma URLs from users (extract node IDs automatically)
- Guide users to open the right file in Figma Desktop
- Cache node ID mappings for common components

### Remote Deployment

To make this work on Vercel:
1. Set up a remote MCP server on a cloud VM
2. Or use tunneling services (ngrok, cloudflare tunnel)
3. Update `FIGMA_MCP_SERVER_URL` to point to remote server

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review `/docs/figma-mcp-tools.md` for detailed tool documentation
3. Run test scripts to verify connection
4. Check Figma Desktop and MCP server logs
